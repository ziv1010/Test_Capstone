The available tools don't include a direct way to run the pipeline, but maybe I can guide them through the necessary steps.\n\nFirst, since the pipeline stages after Stage 2 are not run, the task hasn't been processed. The user might need to create a custom task or check if there's another way to proceed. Wait, TSK-002 is already a proposed task, so maybe they need to trigger execution through another method. But according to the tools provided, the only options are to check status, get summaries, etc.\n\nI should inform the user that the pipeline execution isn't possible with the current tools and suggest alternatives. Maybe they can create a custom task using their query, but since TSK-002 exists, perhaps they need to contact the administrator or use an external interface. Alternatively, they might need to check if there's a different function they can use. I'll explain the situation clearly and offer to help with other available actions.\n</think>\n\nThe pipeline execution for TSK-002 hasn't been initiated yet. Since we can't directly trigger pipeline execution with the current toolset, here are your options:\n\n1. **Check if this task can be rephrased as a custom query**:\n   Would you like to try rephrasing \"Predict Rice Export Volumes to Bangladesh\" as a natural language query for our evaluation?\n\n2. **View available data**:\n   We could examine the underlying datasets that would be used for this task.\n\n3. **Get more task details**:\n   The task proposal might need clarification before execution.\n\nWhat would you like to do next?",
