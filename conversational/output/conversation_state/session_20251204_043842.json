I need to explain that I can't execute the pipeline directly but can guide them through the steps.\n\nFirst, I'll inform them about the error and clarify my role. Then, I'll outline the next steps they can take, like checking the pipeline status or evaluating their query again. I'll also offer to help create a custom task if needed. Keeping the response helpful and suggesting possible actions is key here.\n</think>\n\nIt looks like I can't directly execute the pipeline, but I can help guide you through the process! Here's what we can do next:\n\n1. **Check pipeline status**: See which stages have already been completed\n2. **Evaluate query**: Confirm if the task is still feasible with current data\n3. **Create custom task**: If needed, refine the task parameters\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Show the current pipeline status?\n- Re-evaluate the forecasting feasibility?\n- Help create a modified version of this task?",
