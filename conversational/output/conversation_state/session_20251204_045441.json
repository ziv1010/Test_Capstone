        "content": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user initially tried to run \"tsk 1\", which I assumed was task 1. But the system said that \"run_pipeline\" isn't a valid tool. Then, after checking the available tasks, I see there's TSK-001 and others. The pipeline status shows that some stages are completed, like Stage 3 with PLAN-TSK-9586 and PLAN-TSK-001.\n\nSo, the user probably wants to run TSK-001. But how? The available functions don't include a \"run_pipeline\" tool. Wait, maybe the correct approach is to check if the task is already in the execution plan. The pipeline status shows that PLAN-TSK-001 is in Stage 3 (Execution Plan) and Stage 3B (Data Preparation) is done. But Stages 3.5A, 3.5B, 4, and 5 are not run yet.\n\nThe user might need to proceed with the next stages. But since the tools don't have a run_pipeline function, maybe the assistant should guide the user through the available functions. For example, if the task is already in the execution plan, maybe the next step is to check the execution results or visualizations once they're done. Alternatively, if the user wants to create a custom task, they can use create_custom_task_from_query.\n\nWait, the user's original request was to run a task, but the system doesn't have a direct function for that. The assistant needs to explain that the task is already in the pipeline and guide the user on what to do next, like checking the status or proceeding with the next stages if possible. Since the tools are limited, the assistant can't trigger the execution directly but can inform the user about the current status and available options.\n</think>\n\nThe task TSK-001 (\"Forecast Food Grain Production in India\") is ready to execute! \n\nCurrent status:\n- ✅ Execution plan created (PLAN-TSK-001)\n- ✅ Data preparation completed\n- 🚧 Next steps: Method proposals and benchmarking\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Show the execution plan details for TSK-001?\n2. Check if any prerequisites are missing?\n3. Guide you through the next pipeline stages?\n\n<tools>\n{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"get_execution_results\", \"description\": \"Get results from executed tasks\", \"parameters\": {\"properties\": {\"plan_id\": {\"default\": null, \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"type\": \"object\"}}}\n{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"get_visualizations\", \"description\": \"Get visualization reports\", \"parameters\": {\"properties\": {\"plan_id\": {\"default\": null, \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"type\": \"object\"}}}\n</tools>",
