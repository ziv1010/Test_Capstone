I should confirm if they want to run TSK-001. Also, there are other tasks with similar names like TSK-9586 and TSK-9680, but they might be duplicates or variations. I need to make sure the user specifies which exact task they want. Since the user wrote \"tsk 1\", TSK-001 is the most likely candidate. I'll ask for confirmation to proceed with TSK-001.\n</think>\n\nI see you want to run \"task 1\". Based on the proposals, **TSK-001: Forecast Food Grain Production in India** is the first listed task. Would you like to execute this task? \n\nIf so, I'll run the pipeline stages:\n1. Data preparation (3)\n2. Feature engineering (3B)\n3. Model selection (3.5A)\n4. Model training (3.5B)\n5. Forecast generation (4)\n6. Results compilation (5)\n\nConfirm with: \"Run TSK-001\"",
