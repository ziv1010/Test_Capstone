Since TSK-002 is a proposed task, executing it would start from Stage 3. The next steps would be to create an execution plan, prepare data, propose methods, benchmark, execute, and visualize. I need to confirm if the user wants to proceed with running the task, which will trigger these stages. I should explain that running the task will start from Stage 3 and outline the subsequent steps. Let me check if there's any missing information or if the user needs clarification before proceeding.\n</think>\n\nTo execute TSK-002 (\"Predict Crop Yield by State\"), we'll need to run the pipeline from Stage 3 onward. This will:\n\n1. **Stage 3**: Generate execution plan for the task\n2. **Stage 3B**: Prepare required datasets\n3. **Stage 3.5A**: Propose analytical methods\n4. **Stage 3.5B**: Set up benchmarking\n5. **Stage 4**: Execute the analysis\n6. **Stage 5**: Generate visualizations\n\nWould you like to proceed with running this task?",
