        "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user tried to run plan-tsk-002 by using the run_pipeline function, but I got an error saying that run_pipeline isn't a valid tool. Let me check the available tools again. The tools listed are get_available_data, get_summaries, get_task_proposals, check_pipeline_status, evaluate_user_query, create_custom_task_from_query, get_execution_results, and get_visualizations. Run_pipeline isn't among them.\n\nHmm, so the correct way to trigger the pipeline must be through one of these existing functions. Wait, the user's original instruction said that when they want to run a task, I should set pipeline_action to \"run_pipeline\" and include the task_id. But the error says that run_pipeline isn't a valid tool. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. \n\nWait, looking back at the tools provided, there's no function called run_pipeline. The available functions don't include that. So perhaps the correct approach is to use another function. But the user's guidelines mention that when a user wants to run a task, I should trigger the pipeline execution by setting pipeline_action to \"run_pipeline\" with the task_id. However, since that function isn't available, maybe the actual method is different.\n\nWait, maybe the user made a mistake in the initial setup. The tools don't include run_pipeline, but the conversation guidelines mention using it. That's conflicting. How can I proceed? The error message indicates that run_pipeline isn't a valid tool. So perhaps the correct way is to use check_pipeline_status or another function to initiate the run. But according to the tools, none of them seem to handle starting the pipeline. \n\nWait, maybe the user intended to use create_custom_task_from_query, but that's for creating tasks, not running them. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the pipeline status to see if the task can be run. But the user's request was to run a specific task. \n\nGiven the available tools, the closest action might be to check the pipeline status to see if the task is ready, but that's not what the user wants. The user wants to execute the task. Since the tools don't include a run function, perhaps the correct response is to inform the user that the pipeline can't be run directly and suggest using another method. But the initial instructions said to set pipeline_action to \"run_pipeline\" when the user wants to run a task. \n\nThis is confusing. The error indicates that the function isn't available, but the user's guidelines say to use it. Maybe there's a mistake in the tool definitions. Alternatively, perhaps the user should be directed to use a different approach. Since the tools don't include run_pipeline, I need to find another way. \n\nWait, looking back at the tools, maybe the user is supposed to use get_task_proposals to get the tasks and then run them through another method. But the user already has the task ID. Maybe the correct approach is to inform the user that the pipeline execution isn't possible with the current tools and suggest checking the status or other available functions. \n\nBut the user's original query was to run the task, so the assistant's previous response tried to use run_pipeline, which isn't valid. The error message is from the system, so the assistant needs to adjust. The correct action here is to inform the user that the run_pipeline function isn't available and perhaps guide them through the available options, like checking the pipeline status or viewing execution results if the task has been run before. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user needs to create the task first using create_custom_task_from_query, but they already have a task ID. This is a bit of a dead end. The assistant should probably apologize for the confusion and explain the available tools to the user, guiding them on how to proceed given the current toolset.\n</think>\n\nIt seems there was a misunderstanding in the available tools. Let me clarify the options and help you proceed:\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- Check pipeline status: `check_pipeline_status`\n- View execution results: `get_execution_results`\n- View visualizations: `get_visualizations`\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Check the current pipeline status for plan-tsk-002?\n2. Show results if this task has been executed before?\n3. Help with a different task from the available proposals?\n\n<tools>\n{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"check_pipeline_status\", \"description\": \"Check the current status of the pipeline.\\n\\nReturns which stages have been completed and what's available.\", \"parameters\": {\"properties\": {}, \"type\": \"object\"}}}\n{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"get_execution_results\", \"description\": \"Get results from executed tasks.\\n\\nArgs:\\n    plan_id: Specific plan ID.
