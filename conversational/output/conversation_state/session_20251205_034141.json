Oh right, the correct way is to set pipeline_action in the response, not call a function. But the user's instruction says when they want to run a task, I should set pipeline_action to \"run_pipeline\" with the task_id. However, the tools listed don't include run_pipeline. Wait, maybe the error is because I used a tool call instead of setting the pipeline_action in the response.\n\nLooking back at the instructions, the assistant should set pipeline_action = \"run_pipeline\" and include the task_id in the response. So instead of making a tool call, I should structure the response with the pipeline_action. The previous attempt used a tool call which was invalid. The correct approach is to return a JSON object with \"pipeline_action\" and \"task_id\" in the response, not as a tool call. So I need to adjust the response format to trigger the pipeline execution properly.\n</think>\n\n{\"pipeline_action\": \"run_pipeline\", \"task_id\": \"tsk-001\"}",
