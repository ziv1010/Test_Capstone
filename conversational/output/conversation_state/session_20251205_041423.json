Then I fetched the task proposals and saw that TSK-002 exists as a proposed task. The user probably meant to run TSK-002, not the execution plan PLAN-TSK-002. Since TSK-002 is available, I should confirm if they want to execute that task. I need to clarify if they want to run TSK-002, which is \"Predict Crop Yield by Season\". I'll present the options and ask for confirmation.\n</think>\n\nI see task **TSK-002** is available: *\"Predict Crop Yield by Season\"* with 0.8 feasibility.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Run this task (TSK-002) through the pipeline?\n2. Or did you mean a different task ID?\n\nThe pipeline will execute stages 3 → 3B → 3.5A → 3.5B → 4 → 5 for the selected task.",
