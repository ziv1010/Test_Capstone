        "content": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user initially asked to run plan-tsk-004, which I assumed was a valid task. But when I tried to use the run_pipeline tool, it wasn't valid. Then, when I checked the execution results for that plan, there were none. Now, after getting the task proposals, I see that TSK-004 is listed as \"Analyze Export Trends by Rice Variety\". The user probably meant to run this task but used the wrong identifier (PLAN-TSK-004 instead of TSK-004).\n\nSo, the confusion is between the task ID (TSK-004) and the plan ID (PLAN-TSK-004). The user might have thought that the plan ID is the same as the task ID. Since the task proposals show TSK-004 exists, I should clarify that the correct task ID is TSK-004 and ask if they want to run that instead. Also, the previous attempt to run PLAN-TSK-004 didn't work because the valid task ID is TSK-004. I need to inform the user about this discrepancy and guide them to use the correct task ID.\n</think>\n\nThe task identifier appears to be mismatched. The valid task ID is **TSK-004** (as shown in the proposals), not \"PLAN-TSK-004\". Would you like me to:\n\n1. Run **TSK-004**: *Analyze Export Trends by Rice Variety*  \n   (This will execute stages 3.5A → 3.5B → 4 → 5 for this task)\n\n2. Or clarify anything about the task details?\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed!",
